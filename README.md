# Educado backend

Backend for both the Educado webpage (content creator page) and the Educado mobile application (student page).
It mainly serves the webpage and application with data from the database.

Main dependencies:

- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Axios

## Step-by-step guide to run Educado development setup

Below is a short guide explaining how to set up and run the educado backend in development mode.

### Setting up Node environment

- Ensure that local version of Node.js is latest stable version (v20.10.0, at the time of writing this)
  - run `node --version`
  - if version == v20.10.0, then all is good :)
  - if version is NOT v20.10.0 then do the following
    - Ensure that you have npm installed
    - run `npm install -g n` to install node version manager
    - when installed, run `n stable`, to install latest stable version of node

### Setting up local repository

- Download [MongoDB Compass (GUI)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
- Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Go to GitHub page and clone (with ssh or GitHub Desktop) the repository
- Create .env file and gcp_service.json file, for development keys in /config directory
- Get the .env and json file from whoever is in charge of the secrets. The 2023 responsible was Frederik Bode Thorbensen: from Software semester 7 of AAU CPH. The dev keys contain the following values:

### The .env file should contain the following values:

1. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
2. GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
3. MONGO_URI
4. MONGO_URI_TEST
5. TOKEN_SECRET
6. COOKIE_KEY
7. GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
8. GMAIL_USER
9. GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
10. TRANSCODER_SERVICE_URL

### The gcp_service.json file should contain the following fields:

1. type
2. project_id
3. private_key_id
4. private_key
5. client_email
6. client_id
7. auth_uri
8. token_uri
9. auth_provider_x509_cert_url
10. client_x509_cert_url
11. universe_domain

Remember, these secrets are exactly that... **Secrets**... So make extra sure they are git-ignored (or someone will be very mad)

### Installing node dependencies

- In root folder of the repo run `npm install`
- Run `npm install` again

### Run app in development mode

- Run `npm run dev` to start application
- Rest api runs on ://localhost:8888

### Run app in production mode

- Run `npm run prod` to start application
- Rest api runs on ://localhost:8888

## Docker Commands

- `npm run docker`

  - **Description:** Starts the Docker containers in the background.
  - **Command:** `docker-compose up -d`

- `npm run docker_down`

  - **Description:** Stops and removes the Docker containers defined in the Docker Compose configuration.
  - **Command:** `docker-compose down`

- `npm run docker_build`

  - **Description:** Builds and starts the Docker containers in the background. This command will rebuild the containers even if there are cached layers available.
  - **Command:** `docker-compose up -d --build`

- `npm run docker_clean_db`
  - **Description:** Stops and removes the Docker containers and the volume associated with the MongoDB container, and then starts the MongoDB container with a fresh build. This command is useful for resetting the database to a clean state.
  - **Command:** `docker-compose down && docker volume rm educado-backend_mongodb_data && docker-compose up -d --build mongodb`

## Notes

- Itâ€™s important to use the appropriate command depending on whether you are in a development or production environment.
- The Docker commands are intended to be run in an environment where Docker is installed and configured.
- Ensure that no other services are running on the ports that are configured in `docker-compose.yml` to avoid port conflicts.
